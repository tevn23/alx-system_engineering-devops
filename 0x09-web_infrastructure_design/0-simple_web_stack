- What is a server
A server is a powerful computer program running on a dedicated computer system.

- What is the role of the domain name
A domain name is a user-friendly address for a website, instead of remembering complex numerical IP addresses.

- What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
A CNAME record (Canonical Name record).

- What is the role of the web server
A web server acts as the middleman between your web browser and the website you're trying to access.

- What is the role of the application server
It sits between the web server and the database, handling the "behind-the-scenes" logic of the website. It processes user input, interacts with the database, and generates customized web pages based on the user's interaction.

- What is the role of the database
A database stores information in a way that's easy to access, organize, and modify.

- What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
The server communicates with your computer using a set of protocols called the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Issues with this infrastructure:
- Numerous points of failure within the server (if any one fails then the rest of the system crashes)
- Scaling is difficult
- periodic downtime during updates and maintenance
